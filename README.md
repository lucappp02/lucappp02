## 🔭 Current Research

### ⚛️ **Master’s Thesis (WIP)**
**Topic:** Deriving and attaining fundamental precision limits for **time-dependent signals** under **Markovian noise**.  
**Tools:** Quantum metrology, quantum control, quantum error correction, semidefinite programming.

### 💧 **OH Molecule as a Quantum Probe to Jointly Estimate Electric and Magnetic Fields**
**Topic:** Using the **OH molecule** as a quantum sensor to estimate field parameters, analyzing sensitivity and compatibility of the parameters across several scenarios and applying a quantum control scheme to enhance sensitivity.  
**Tools:** Multi-parameter quantum metrology, quantum control.  

**Results:**  
- Derived ultimate precision bounds for ground states, thermal ensembles and several dynamical states.  
- Designed a control scheme to restore quadratic time scaling (lost due to non-commutativity) and proved its robustness.  
➡️ [**Preprint on arXiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13634) | Submitted to *PRA*.

### 💌 **Contact Your Quantum Friends! A Genetic Approach to Chiral Quantum Routing**
**Topic:** Optimizing chiral phases to route quantum information through networks with given topology via continuous-time quantum walks.  
**Tools:** Chiral quantum walks, genetic algorithms.  

**Results:**  
- Characterized performance of 4-, 5-, and 6-output quantum routers.  
- Implemented a genetic algorithm to route both classical and quantum information efficiently.
