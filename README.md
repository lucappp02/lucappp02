# 🐐 Luca — Quantum Physicist

Hi there! I’m **Luca**, a soon-to-be graduate in *Theoretical Physics* from the University of Bologna, with a background in *Physics* from the University of Milan. I’m passionate about quantum technologies, specializing in **quantum metrology**, **quantum control**, and **quantum networks**—always eager to explore new frontiers in physics.

## 🔭 Current Research

### ⚛️ **Master’s Thesis (WIP)**
**Topic:** Deriving and testing fundamental precision limits for **time-dependent signals** under **Markovian noise**.  
**Tools:** Quantum metrology, quantum control, quantum error correction, semidefinite programming.

### 💧 **OH Molecule as a Quantum Probe for Joint Estimation of Electric and Magnetic Fields**
**Topic:** Using the **OH molecule** as a quantum sensor to estimate field parameters, analyzing sensitivity/compatibility across scenarios, and applying quantum control to recover lost precision from non-commutativity.  
**Tools:** Multi-parameter quantum metrology, quantum control.  
**Results:**  
- Derived ultimate precision bounds for ground states, thermal ensembles, and dynamical states.  
- Designed a control scheme to restore quadratic time scaling (lost due to non-commutativity) and proved its robustness.  
➡️ [**Preprint on arXiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13634) | Submitted to *PRA*.

### 💌 **Contact Your Quantum Friends: Genetic Optimization of Chiral Quantum Routing**
**Topic:** Optimizing chiral phases to route quantum information through random networks via continuous-time quantum walks.  
**Tools:** Chiral quantum walks, genetic algorithms.  
**Results:**  
- Characterized performance of 4-, 5-, and 6-output quantum routers.  
- Implemented a genetic algorithm to route quantum/classical information efficiently.
